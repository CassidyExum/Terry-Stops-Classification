# Terry-Stops-Classification

## Creating a Classification model to predict Arrests

The stakeholder of this assignment is Campaign Zero, a national organization devoted to lobbying legislators on ten policy solutions that reduce police violence, including independent oversight, legal bans on the use of force, and the end of for-profit policing. Campaign Zero tasked us with researching Terry Stop data using the Seattle PD data as a sample. Campaign Zero wants to use this data to determine some of the best predictors of arrests.
